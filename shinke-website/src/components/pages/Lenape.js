        text1='The reason for the collaboration and the exhibition is that 2024 will mark 400 years 
        since the Dutch arrived in America at the mouth of the Hudson to found a colony. 
        After that colony was conquered by the English from the Dutch in 1664, 
        the settlement grew into the city of New York in the following centuries. 
        The Dutch invasion and decades of colonization in this area had major consequences for 
        the Indigenous population who lived in the area and on the island they called Manahahtáanung in the 17th century. 
        They lost their land and became victims of diseases, wars and loss of livelihood. 
        Colonists deliberately made it impossible for Indigenous people to maintain their own way of life and culture. 
        At the same time, 
        there has always been resistance from Indigenous communities, 
        even to this day.'
